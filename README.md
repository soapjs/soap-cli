# SOAP CLI

SOAP CLI is a command-line interface designed to streamline the development of software projects by offering a suite of tools and templates for creating, initializing, and managing project components and structure. It provides a dynamic, user-friendly approach to project setup, allowing developers to generate project files and configurations through an interactive process, without needing to manually write JSON or configuration files.

## Key Features

- **Project Initialization**: Quickly bootstrap new projects with predefined templates and configurations.
- **Interactive Forms**: Build project components interactively in the console by answering questions and describing specific fields.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extend functionality with plugins for different programming languages, web frameworks, and databases.
- **Session Management**: Resume interrupted sessions (e.g., accidental terminal closures) to continue where you left off.
- **Configurable**: Customize project setups through `.soap/` directory and JSON configuration files.

## Usage

To start using SOAP CLI, install it globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @soapjs/soap-cli
```

Once installed, you can create new projects, add components, or manage existing projects by invoking the `soap` command followed by specific actions and options. For detailed instructions and full command list, refer to the official documentation:

[SOAP CLI Documentation](https://docs.soapjs.com)

## Requirements

SOAP CLI requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your system. Ensure your environment is set up before running the CLI.
